# EntsCpp
C++ implementation of Ents Hierarchy Database.

-- USE CAUTION: UNTESTED EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM COULD CORRUPT DRIVE --

See openpatterns.net/#ents for description of intended functionality.

Basic functionality of CLI explorer/editor has been added.

Use command "h" to display a list of commands, and "exit" to exit.

It is suggested to write database files to a devoted external drive for now,
in case a bug corrupts the file system. A random USB drive can be repartitioned
easily.

Change directory the program writes to by changing the string "fileDirectory" in
src/Util/IO.cpp
