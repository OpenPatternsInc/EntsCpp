The Core folder contains the classes that are fundamental to the Ents Database
implementation.

None of the files in Core require files in other folders and so it acts as
an independent base to add to.

For example, the Interface folder for creating user interfaces is not required
by Core, and so Core can be declared first, allowing Interface to fully use all
classes in Core, without using forward declarations.
